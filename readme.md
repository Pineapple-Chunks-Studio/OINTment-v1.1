# PM Control Suite

Early documentation and starter UI for a project manager control platform. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture, data model, and execution plan.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The home page now links to key interfaces:

- **Upload ZIP / GitHub Repo** &mdash; manual ingestion or GitHub analysis at `/ingest`
- **View Matrix** &mdash; integration matrix prototype at `/matrix`
- **Track Commits** &mdash; 3D commit map at `/tracking`

`npm test` runs a TypeScript type check.

*Binary assets such as `.ico` files are intentionally excluded.*

## Integration Matrix

The `/matrix` page inspects this project's `package.json` to list real dependencies.
For each dependency, the server resolves a homepage and displays its favicon via
Clearbit, providing a quick visual snapshot of the stack along with placeholder
readiness scores. Beneath the matrix, expandable widgets surface risk and
coverage details, a progress timeline, and a pie chart showing the distribution
of integration categories.

## Manual Ingestor

Upload a repository ZIP or point to a GitHub repo/branch at `/ingest` to trigger
an analysis run. Provide an API key for language model analysis via
`AIML_API_KEY` (uses [aimlapi.com](https://aimlapi.com) by default); the app now
targets the `gpt-5` chat model and automatically falls back to `gpt-4o` if
needed. The last
ingest result along with your selected repo and branch are cached in the browser
so you can navigate away and return without losing context. Below the console,
AIâ€‘extracted takeaways and metrics render in animated widgets.

Click a row on the Matrix page to drill into indicator explanations, improvement
tips and code references gathered from the repo.

The code reference API now searches the entire workspace using `ripgrep`,
surfacing up to twenty matching lines across TypeScript, JavaScript, and JSON
files instead of only showing `package.json` entries.
