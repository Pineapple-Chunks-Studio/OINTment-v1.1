# PM Control Suite

Early documentation and starter UI for a project manager control platform. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture, data model, and execution plan.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app exposes an Integration Matrix prototype at `/matrix`.

`npm test` runs a TypeScript type check.

*Binary assets such as `.ico` files are intentionally excluded.*
