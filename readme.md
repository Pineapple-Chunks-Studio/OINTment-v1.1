# PM Control Suite

Early documentation and starter UI for a project manager control platform. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture, data model, and execution plan.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The home page now links to key interfaces:

- **Upload ZIP** &mdash; manual ingestion at `/ingest`
- **View Matrix** &mdash; integration matrix prototype at `/matrix`

`npm test` runs a TypeScript type check.

*Binary assets such as `.ico` files are intentionally excluded.*

## Integration Matrix

The `/matrix` page inspects this project's `package.json` to list real dependencies.
For each dependency, the server resolves a homepage and displays its favicon via
Clearbit, providing a quick visual snapshot of the stack along with placeholder
readiness scores.

## Manual Ingestor

Upload a repository ZIP at `/ingest` to trigger an analysis run. Provide an API
key for language model analysis via `AIML_API_KEY` (uses
[aimlapi.com](https://aimlapi.com) by default) or fall back to
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for the standard OpenAI endpoint. This powers the GPTâ€‘5
summaries of uploaded contents.
